	<section name="Development overview">
	<p>
	  First steps (we assume that you have a proper maven and php-maven setup including the settings to php-mavens repository):
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>At first you should setup eclipse.
	    <ul>
	    <li>Install at least 1.6 jdk: <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a></li>
	    <li>Download eclipse ide for java developers: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">eclipye download url</a>.</li>
	    <li>After first starting eclipse set the proper jdk at window->preferences->java->installed JRE (eclipse may only see the jre and not the jdk</li>
	    <li>Install checkstyle plugin: <a href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/downloads.html">Install manual</a></li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Clone git
	    <ul>
	    <li>1st Variant: clone the whole git: <a href="https://github.com/php-maven/maven-php-plugin">github link</a>. Import the root folder project into
	        the eclipse worksace (right click in git perspective and "import projects").</li>
	    <li>2nd Variant: clone a single branch or a single tag. To let the build work correct you must create a small directory structure similar to the
	        git repository. Create the folders "/dev" and "/tags", as well as "/branches". Clone the tag or branch you need inside them. The dev folder is
	        git-ignored and is used to store some runtime data during build and test. You may use it to store your own launch configurations.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Setup checkstyle
	    <ul>
	    <li>If you did not checkout the whole git tree you should manually download the checkstyle rules from
	        <a href="https://github.com/php-maven/maven-php-plugin/blob/master/var/checkstyle/src/main/resources/phpmaven/checkstyle.xml">GIThub</a>.
	        Setup checkstyle at window->preferences->checkstyle->global check configurations. Create a profile called "PHP Maven" and select the checkstyle
	        xml.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Checkout projects
	    <ul>
	    <li>Right click on the root and click import->Maven->"Existing maven projects". At the following dialog expand the "advanced" section and select
	        the name template "[artifactId]-[version]". This will allow you to use several branches and tags at once.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section name="The modules">
	<p><b>archetypes</b> represents the archetypes phpmaven provides. In this project there is a overview: archetypes/src/site/xdoc/index.xml
	   where all the archetypes are explained. It is a good place to put third party archetypes there.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-core</b> holds the component factory. It will be explained later on.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-exec</b> support php cli executions.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-jettycgi</b> is a small CGI servlet for jetty. It can be used for web projects.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-pear</b> provides pear instrumentation and pear channel analysis.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-phar</b> is able to extract, read and create phar archives.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-phpdoc</b> creates phpdoc reports.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-phpunit</b> performs unit testing and code coverage analysis.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-plugin</b> contains all the mojos for the build lifecycle.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-plugin-test</b> contains all unit test code for every other plugin, maybe the mojos or the utility modules.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-project</b> is similar to maven-php-exec but adds the include paths (/target/classes etc.) to the php executable.</p>
	<p><b>maven-php-validate-lint</b> performs lint checks on php files.</p>
	<p><b>php-parent-pom</b> is the recommended parent pom we are providing.</p>
	<p><b>src/site</b> contains the default web site for documentation of the branch or tag.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section name="The configuration factory">
	<p>The module maven-php-core supports a configuration factory. You may use it in mojos by declaring the proper private variable:</p>
	<source>
/**
 * The configuration factory.
 * @component
 */
private IComponentFactory factory;

/**
 * The maven session.
 * @parameter expression="${session}"
 */
private MavenSession session;
	</source>
	<p>You can receive new components by invoking the lookup method:</p>
	<source>
final IMyComponent component = this.factory.lookup(IMyComponent.class, IComponentFactory.EMPTY_CONFIG, this.session);
	</source>
	<p>You can pass any Xpp3Dom object as configuration to this method. It results in the correct component. It is using the plexus container.
	   For details read the <a href="http://plexus.codehaus.org/writing-components-trail/index.html">plexus component manual</a>.</p>
	<p>Why do we not use the container directly? The maven-php-core component factory adds some useful extensions on the plexus container.
	   At first you can customize the received component via Xpp3Dom configuration. That is important. For example you wish to add a
	   configuration element to your mojo that customizes the component. The second extension is the automatic pom-like configuration.
	   The plexus container itself does not know anything about poms and pom configurations but we want to rely on them.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section name="Using a pom expression configuration.">
	<p>You can add a configuration for every variable based on expressions. The following example shows a configuration option setting
	a sub path of the project base dir:</p>
	<source>
 /**
  * Some path.
  */
@ConfigurationParameter(name = "somePath", expression = "${project.basedir}/target/some-path")
private File somePath;
	</source>
	</section>
	
	<section name="Using a build configuration.">
	<p>You can automatically pass any build configuration to the component by adding the @BuildPluginConfiguration annotation to the any
	   class or interface. This allows you to automatically read the build configuration of the current pom (the pom returned by
	   parameter session.getCurrentProject while invoking lookup):</p>
	<source>
@BuildPluginConfiguration(groupId = "org.phpmaven", artifactId = "maven-php-anyplugin")
	</source>
	<p>We are using the following order for overwriting configuration; the top most entry is applied first; the last entry is overwriting the previous entries:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>@Configuration annotations of the plexus component.</li>
	<li>@ConfigurationParameter annotation.</li>
	<li>@BuildPluginConfiguration of the implementing class and the base classes/interfaces (no guaranteed ordering).</li>
	<li>Configuration given to the invoke method; the first array entry is passed first.</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section name="Example: Executing php.">
	<p>First we will receive a php configuration.</p>
	<source>
final IPhpExecutableConfiguration execConfig = this.factory.lookup(IPhpExecutableConfiguration.class, IComponentFactory.EMPTY_CONFIG, this.session);
    </source>
    <p>This is not that difficult. You can customize it, for example add an include path:</p>
    <source>
execConfig.getIncludePath().add("target/my-gen-path");
    </source>
    <p>Now you are able to receive the php executable:</p>
    <source>
final IPhpExecutable exec = execConfig.getPhpExecutable(getLog());
    </source>
    <p>Notice that this will silently copy the configuration. If you now change the execConfig it won't influence the php executable you already created.
    Let us now invoke a script:</p>
    <source>
final String output = exec.executeCode("", "phpinof();");
    </source>
    <p>Notice that we will now receive a "PhpException" because php will complain and fail with this script. The method "phpinfo" was not correctly spelled.
       That's it. Most of the other plugins are done in a similar way. There is always an interface you should lookup with the component factory. This
       interface leads to the functionality of the module. For example the IPhpunitConfiguration interface.</p>
