		A continuous integration server helps you with the quality control of your project.

		<section name="Continuous integration at xworlds">
		<p>
		The continuous integration server is an additional service within xworlds. It is only allowed for modules that are hosted at xworlds.
		To understand what a CI server does you should read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">wikipedia article</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To enable continuous integration you need to specify it for either a single module or version. The CI server can either simply build
		the project or even release them on demand. That means: as soon as there is a new version in your version control system the CI server
		is able to deploy both, the modules and the site.
		</p>
		
		<p>After creating a CI server follow the steps to configure the behaviour. You may change the configuration later on as you like.
		What a while and you will see that the CI server starks working and starts scanning and building the versions. The CI links are
		available to public.</p>
		
		<p>To let the CI server work correctly it will scan for the correct values in the pom.xml. That means: The deployment section
		and the url must be valid. If you change anything here the CI server will complain.</p>
		
		<p>Clicking on a module or a single version shows the CI server result as links. You can then navigate through the links
		and see the build results.</p>
