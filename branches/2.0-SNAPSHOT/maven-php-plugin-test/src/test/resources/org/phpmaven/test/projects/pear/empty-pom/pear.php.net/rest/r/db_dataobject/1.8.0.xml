 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>Major Bug Fix &amp; Feature release.

Bugs:

#4871 - remove warning when value is not found in table
#4834 - case sensitive checks for db_dataobject_cast fail
#4894 - Validate methods can return PEAR Errors, or even
        messages now.. - only true indicates success
#4938 - support MONEY type for MSSQL
#4968 - count() will not be affected by changing default
        db fetchmode
#5036 - make sure DB is loaded before using it
#5264 - add optional dep on MDB
#5416 - use tablea AS tableb only for postgress/mysql -
        oracle doesnt need the AS bit - and I guess a few others too..
        available and first fetch fails
        conditions
#5614 - joinAdd check to see if object being joined is
        really a dataobject
#5065 - count returns number cast to an integer (even
        though database may return a string)
#5800 - generator will continue creating other tables if we find one
        that fails...
#5881 - wrap conditions with extra brackets
        remaining checks in validate
#5393 - flag up unique only keys as &quot;U&quot;, rather than &quot;K&quot;
        (or &quot;N&quot; for native) to allow anything calling keys() to find more
        detailed information - should have no effect on the dataobject
        class, as only sequence keys looks for &quot;K&quot;

Feature Requests:

#5146 - option: generator_var_keyword,
        to specify if you want to use var or public

Other Changes

    default behaviour.. so it shouldnt really have affected anyone..
    amazed no one picked this up before..
* make WHERE stripping better  = well spotted Justin
* catch errors returned from nextID - like permission denied etc.,
    add warnings in debug mode if we are using objects  or arrays for
    some reason, fix error messages
* correct the dependancy on packages
* the dont die here causes a recursive error and segfaults
    everything if it doesnt return..
* use is_a, rather than PEAR, as one day we may remove that dep...
* fix PHP4.4* issues with returning by reference..
* make debugging schema loading errors a bit easier
* test for bug #5931 added to test 91
* update($dataobject), change check for changes to strict checking,
    so that 0001 -&gt; 00001 works, along with many other situations..,
    remove extra ; from code
* fix null detection on postgres, - patch by Alistair MacDonald
* free result columns as well as results after fetching all rows.</n>
