		<title>Maven for PHP - Migration from version 1</title>
		<author email="mep_eisen@web.de">Martin Eisengardt</author>
	</properties>

		<section name="Migration">
		<p>Change build configuration:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>To declare additional parameters for runtime use configuration property &quot;additionalPhpParameters&quot;.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Change reporting.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>As of maven3 the reporting is changed. Move the reporting tag to the build configuration of maven-site plugin. See our <a href="php-lib-5min.xml">5 Minutes example</a> for details.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Use newer PHP versions. We dropped support for PHP4. Because of phar support we need at least PHP 5.2.0.
		Read the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/phar.requirements.php">PHP manual</a> for details. Packages in zip or
		jar format can be fairly important into php-maven2 without the need to convert the whole repository.</p>
		<p>The phpunit dependency is changed. It is know using the pear names. Group-ID de.phpunit (from pear.phpunit.de) and the
		artifactId PHPUnit (Notice the case).</p>
