<section name="Installation">

<p>
  You should first get a working maven 3 installation. All additional stuff will be handled by maven itself.
  <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">To maven downloads</a>
</p>

<p>
  As soon as you are able to invoke maven (command line mvn) everything will be fine. Before using maven for php
  you must tell maven where to find it. Have a look at the <a href="prepare.html">prepare</a> page.
</p>

<p>
  Now that&apos;s it. There is no additional setup needed. Maven will now find maven for php and it will find
  all the nice modules already being created and uploaded to the repository.
