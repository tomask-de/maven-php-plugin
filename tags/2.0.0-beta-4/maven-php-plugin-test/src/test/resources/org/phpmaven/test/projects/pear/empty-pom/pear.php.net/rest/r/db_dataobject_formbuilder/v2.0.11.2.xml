 <s>Class to automatically build HTML_QuickForm objects from a DB_DataObject-derived class</s>
 <d>DB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application development using the packages DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject´s createTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up DataObject´s links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table's entries. There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.

-fieldsToRender should always be shown, even if not in preDefOrder (bug #3182)
-Added prepareLinkedDataObject support for crosslinks and triplelinks
-&quot;Required&quot; rule should not be applied to boolean fields
-Fixed notices of undefined $key with prepareLinkedDataObject when processing tripleLinks and crossLinks
-Use eval for call-time-pass-by-ref to avoid the warning (bug #3230)
-Added selectAddEmptyLabel which allow setting of the label for an empty option
-Fixed DATETIME type checking (was catching TIME elements)
-Added a new datetime element to QF driver
-Added dateTimeElementFormat option
-New datetime type supports datetimeoptions callback in DO
-Added language for time element (uses dateFieldLanguage)
-Fix copy-paste error (bug #3333)
-Fix auto-required rules not working with elementNamePre/Postfix (bug #3343)
-Added elementTypeMap support for selects
-Time / Date processing changes for Bug #3330
-- If only a time is passed to _date2Array it will prepend today's date to that PEAR::Date will process it correctly
-- You no longer have to have all 3 date fields specified for a date to be output from _array2date
--- For example, f only a day is specified, it will put 0000 for year and 00 for month
--- The same applies to times *except* that seconds will only be output of they are specified
---- If only an hour and minute are specified (or only one of the 2) you will get H:i with no s
---- If only seconds are specified you would get 0 for hour and minute</n>
