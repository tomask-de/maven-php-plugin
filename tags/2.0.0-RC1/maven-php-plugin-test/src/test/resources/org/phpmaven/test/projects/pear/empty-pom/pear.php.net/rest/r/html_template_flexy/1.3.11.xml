 <s>An extremely powerful Tokenizer driven Template engine</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Flexy started it's life as a simplification of HTML_Template_Xipe, 
however in Version 0.2, It became one of the first template engine to use a real Lexer,
rather than regex'es, making it possible to do things like ASP.net or Cold Fusion tags. 
However, it still has a very simple set of goals.
- Very Simple API, 
   o easy to learn...
   o prevents to much logic going in templates
- Easy to write document'able code
   o By using object vars for a template rather than 'assign', you 
     can use phpdoc comments to list what variable you use.
- Editable in WYSIWYG editors
   o you can create full featured templates, that doesnt get broken every time you edit with 
     Dreamweaver(tm) or Mozilla editor
   o Uses namespaced attributes to add looping/conditionals  
- Extremely Fast, 
   o runtime is at least 4 time smaller than most other template engines (eg. Smarty)
   o uses compiled templates, as a result it is many times faster on blocks and loops than 
     than Regex templates (eg. IT/phplib)
- Safer (for cross site scripting attacks)
   o All variables default to be output as HTML escaped (overridden with the :h modifier)
- Multilanguage support
   o Parses strings out of template, so you can build translation tools
   o Compiles language specific templates (so translation is only done once, not on every request)
- Full dynamic element support (like ASP.NET), so you can pick elements to replace at runtime

Features:
- {variable} to echo $object-&gt;variable
- {method()} to echo $object-&gt;method();
- {foreach:var,key,value} to PHP foreach loops
- tag attributes FLEXY:FOREACH, FLEXY:IF for looping and conditional HTML inclusion
- {if:variable} to PHP If statement
- {if:method()} to PHP If statement
- {else:} and {end:} to close or alternate If statements
- FORM to HTML_Template_Flexy_Element's
- replacement of INPUT, TEXTAREA and SELECT tags with HTML_Template_Flexy_Element code
  use FLEXY:IGNORE (inherited) and FLEXY:IGNOREONLY (single) to prevent replacements
- FLEXY:START/FLEXY:STARTCHILDREN tags to define where template starts/finishes
- support for urlencoded braces {} in HTML attributes.  
- documentation in the pear manual
